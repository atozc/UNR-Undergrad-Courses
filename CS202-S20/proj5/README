Project 5

Purpose: This program takes 2 classes with an inheritance relationship, a base and derived class, to implement and test into a test program that is provided by the professor. More importantly, the purpose of this project is learn how to create and use inheritance with C++ classes. 

Design: I chose to design this program building from test program. Adding, I created two classes, one base and one derived, along with its header files. From there, I was able to build the program and implement the inheritance relationship. 

Problems: To be honest, I did not have many issues with this program in terms of creating it. I found it to be quite straight forward. On the other hand, I had issues trying to compile the program using CMake. I consistently had the error of CMake not recognizing my header files. With trial and error, I was able to solve the issue. 

Possible Changes: Given more time, I would do more/more detailed comments.
