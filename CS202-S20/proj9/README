Name: Project 9 
Author: Crystal Atoz

Purpose: The purpose of the program was to create two versions of the queue data structure with an array-based method and the other a node-based method.

Design: I designed the program around the DataType files along with the two classes given in the project guidelines. With that, it was straight forward.  

Problems: I did not have any issues with the project. As a side note, I found it easier to work with the node-based method. 

Possible Changes: Given more time, I would add more detailed comments.
