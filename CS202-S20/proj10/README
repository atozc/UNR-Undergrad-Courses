Name: Project 10 
Author: Crystal Atoz

Purpose: The purpose of the project was to understand and use stack-based dynamic data structures as well as using templates in programs. 

Design: I designed the program around the given classes for ArrayStack, NodeStack, and Node. 

Problems: I had issues trying to separate the Node Class and Node Stack class into two separate header files. Instead, I combined them into just one header file: NodeStack.h.

Possible Changes: Given more time, I would add more detailed comments.
