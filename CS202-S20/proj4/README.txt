Project 4

Purpose: The purpose of the program is to continue with having the user renting a car. 

Design: This program was a continuation of project 3 with adding the implementation of extra classes.

Problems: An issue I had was creating all the classes and working with them all. I also had problems making the makefile. The biggest issue I had was that my program compiled, but it only displayed the menu prompt in an infinite loop that I could not figure out how to do. 

Possible Changes: If given more time, I would add comments to my functions.
